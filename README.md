I am a pre-final year CS undergraduate at IIIT Hyderabad, majoring in AI Security. I have led technical teams across a variety of industries and research domains and am always drawn to projects that have the potential to make a meaningful impact in peopleâ€™s lives.

Together, we are stronger than the sum of our code. I have worked on various open-source projects through my participation in Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in, including Jenkins, Joomla, Dask, OpenMRS, WildFly, RTEMS, and CIRQ. These experiences have allowed me to contribute to the development of essential technologies but also mentor and guide others in their journey with open source. Whether it was reducing support ticket volume by over 30% at Joomla through the creation of guided tours or optimising the Dask collections visualisation by 600% at Dask, I am constantly seeking ways to make a difference through open source. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to be a part of these incredible communities.
