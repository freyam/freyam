I’m an engineer who thrives on turning ambitious ideas into robust systems that deliver—reliably, securely, and at scale. Whether it’s integrating AI models into secure infrastructures or designing real-time solutions to handle thousands of requests per second, I focus on building systems that solve today’s challenges and stand ready for tomorrow’s demands.

As the Founding AI/ML Security Engineer at Realm Labs, I’m designing architectures where security is not an afterthought but an inherent part of the system. My work involves creating frameworks that are both high-performing and secure, enabling seamless model integration and real-time decision-making under stringent latency requirements.

Previously, at Oracle, I redefined security for cloud-native applications, leading efforts to make systems more resilient and adaptable to modern threats. My approach centered on building solutions that grow with complexity, ensuring long-term reliability and scalability. At AVID ML, I focused on the ethical dimensions of AI, developing tools like BiasAware to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in AI systems. I’ve also published research on integrating observability into the AI lifecycle, promoting transparency and accountability across the board.

Beyond my professional roles, I’ve contributed to open-source projects like Jenkins and Dask through initiatives such as Google Summer of Code, staying connected to the broader development community.

At the core of my work is a drive to solve complex problems with clarity and precision, ensuring that every system I build doesn’t just meet expectations—it exceeds them.
