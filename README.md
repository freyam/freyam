My name is Freyam Mehta, and I hold a B.Tech. (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, specializing in AI/ML and Security. I am passionate about leveraging technology to make a meaningful impact and am grateful for the opportunities I've had to lead technical teams across various industries and research domains.

My career spans AI/ML security, cloud security, and technical product management. I have been fortunate to enhance security frameworks, optimize disaster recovery processes, and streamline operational workflows. Currently, as a Founding AI/ML Security Engineer at Realm (Stealth), I have contributed to scaling our efforts from prototype to General Availability (GA), securing our first enterprise customers, and improving security through innovative frameworks and models. My previous internships at Oracle, Pradical, and Temperate allowed me to design and implement solutions that improved security, operational efficiency, and user engagement.

My research focuses on the ethical use of AI to drive positive societal outcomes. At AVID ML, I published work on embedding observability in the GenAI product lifecycle and developed BiasAware, a real-time framework for identifying security vulnerabilities and biases. My research at Precog examined COVID-19 vaccine distribution disparities, aiming to inform data-driven healthcare policies. I also actively contribute to open-source projects like Jenkins, Joomla, and Dask through the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program.

Leadership has been an essential part of my journey. At Pradical and Temperate, I led teams that worked on microservice architectures and custom dashboards, which significantly boosted user engagement and operational efficiency.

Beyond technology, sports have been an integral part of my life. I have had the honor of leading and representing teams in cricket, basketball, volleyball, and swimming at both school and university levels. These experiences have instilled in me discipline, dedication, and a competitive spirit, which I carry into every professional challenge. I am committed to continuous learning and am always eager to collaborate and grow with others.
