I'm an avid admirer of the open-source world. I have had the pleasure of contributing to and being part of some of the most incredible communities such as Dask, Google Cirq, Joomla!, OpenMRS, LibreHealth, RTEMS and CCExtractor. I'm grateful to Google Summer of Code for kindling my love for open-source, first as a student and then as a mentor!
