Hi, I am Freyam. I love to bring ideas to reality! I am a sophomore at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). Everywhere I go, I bring a smile, motivation, and cute pictures of dogs and cats. You'll find me eager to get my hands dirty and keen to get started on something fresh and intriguing.

I am still just a clueless retriever running around in circles when it comes to finding my passion in a particular CS field as I find myself intrigued by almost anything new and exciting! More recently, I've been learning about the latest trends in the field of Network Security and Blockchain. NFTs sound fun (but what are they? idk).

Here are some of my favourite (in no particular order) open source shenanigans:

### 🐧 Contributions

-   **Dask ([`dask/dask`](https://github.com/dask/dask))** is a python library providing scalable analytics for big data computations.
    I worked on the project "[Visualizing the Performance Characteristics of Computations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/4961535251709952/)" as part of the Google Summer of Code 2021. My project focuses on improving the visualization of the Graphical and the HTML Representations of Dask computations. I worked on making them more illustrative, engaging, and informative.

    Some of the features I worked on:

    -   Add node size scaling to the Graphviz output for the high level graphs ([`dask#7869`](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7869))
    -   Add dask.array SVG to the HTML Repr ([`dask#7886`](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7886))
    -   Add tooltips to graphviz ([`dask#7973`](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7973))
    -   Add colors to represent high level layer types ([`dask#7974`](https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7974))
    -   Add HTML Repr for Security Class ([`distributed#5178`](https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/5178))
    -   Add HTML Repr for ProcessInterface Class and all its subclasses ([`distributed#5181`](https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/5181))

    I am working on revamping the visualizations of Quantum circuits and adding interactive tools to illustrate the differences between circuits.

> Cirq was something I tried as I wanted to know how the hell these quantum algorithms work and interact with each other. It's super cool and I am very excited about the features I would be adding to it.

-   **LLVM Multi-Level Intermediate Representation ([`llvm/llvm-project::mlir`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project))** is a flexible infrastructure for modern optimizing compilers.
    I am working on designing a tool to visually illustrate the transformations in the Intermediate Representations of data flow in a program.

> I also presented at the weekly MLIR meet up regarding my work here. The recording of that meeting can be found [here](https://youtu.be/fOz0C-X2ma4).

-   **OpenMRS ([`openmrs`](https://github.com/openmrs))** is an EMR storage and retrieval system for treating patients around the globe.

We are still adding features when we feel like.

> Varshita and I love Barkely so much! He was named after a dog butler from the famous show Modern Family.

-   **TETI (Text Encryption Through Images) ([`x3z3/TETI`](https://github.com/x3z3/TETI))** is a project Anshul ([`x3z3`](https://github.com/x3z3/)) and I worked on to encrypt text messages using BMP images by using a custom sophisticated steganographical model for the encryption.

-   **Markdown But Prettier ([`varshitakolipaka/MarkdownButPrettier`](https://github.com/varshitakolipaka/MarkdownButPrettier))** is a project Varshita ([`varshitakolipaka`](https://github.com/varshitakolipaka) and I worked on to make Markdown more exciting by adding a bunch of features such as HTML Styles, and Graphviz Mind Maps.

> Varshita and I were crying while learning the regex for the parsers. OMG! Nothing worked!

### 🦒 Personal Projects

-   **Amigos ([`freyam/amigos`](https://github.com/freyam/amigos))** is a robust friend management application that suggests friends. Its sole mission is to unite compatible people across the world. Just tell the app a bit about yourself, and then let the magic begin.

> Now, I am not saying that Amigos is the next Facebook or Instagram. It is just a simple CLI application that is built on the idea of friendship. Also, I don't think either of those Meta applications can show you a beautiful colorful graph of your friendship network. (Amigos: 1, Facebook/Instagram: 0)

-   **GoodBoy ([`freyam/goodboy`](https://github.com/freyam/goodboy))** is a discord bot that contextually sends cute hand-picked animal pictures to wholesomify the atmosphere.

> This has to be my personal favourite! I love it!

-   **Freyam's real-time e=!mc^2 shell ([`freyam/fresh`](https://github.com/freyam/fresh))** is a linux shell which supports multiple commands and multiple arguments such as `cd`, `echo`, `history`, `ls`, `pinfo`, `pwd`, `repeat`, `jobs`, `sig`, `fg`, `bg`, `replay`, and signal handling. Basically, just a little behind zsh!

-   **xv6-riscv ([`freyam/xv6-riscv`](https://github.com/freyam/xv6-riscv))** is a RISCV simulator for the xv6 operating system. I added several new features such as system tracing, scheduling mechanisms (RR, FCFS, PBS, etc.), and a Procdump.

> OS is sooooooooooooooooo hard!

-   **Specifi ([`freyam/Specifi`](https://github.com/freyam/Specifi))** is an Android app that gamifies the classification of trees (it can be any object). It is an offline-first application with an intuitive user interface for ease of use.

-   **Pikachu Objectifier ([`freyam/pikachu-objectifier`](https://github.com/freyam/pikachu-objectifier))** is a simple home-trained model for classifying pikachus. 481 Pikachus have been blatantly objectified in this repository. I take no responsibility for my actions.

-   **Object Detection with YOLOv3 ([`freyam/object-detection`](https://github.com/freyam/object-detection))** is a project I worked on to detect daily-used objects in images. This was a guided project that I developed to learn the necessary skills to implement my own classifier (Pikachu Classifer).

-   **Terrain Maneuver ([`freyam/TerrainManeuver`](https://github.com/freyam/TerrainManeuver))** is a cross-platform Unity AR mobile application that maps terrain in real time using the mobile's camera utility. This was a guided project that I developed to learn C#. In reality, it's just a big ugly box, but who's stopping me from pitching it as the SpaceX's next utility rover (:

> Guided Projects are easy, but I get to learn so much from them. So, I always look forward to them.

-   **GYSA (GIF Your Sorrows Away) ([`freyam/gif-your-sorrows-away `](https://github.com/freyam/gif-your-sorrows-away))** is a browser extension that displays adorable GIFs of cute animals on your screen at random.

> GYSA inspired me to create GoodBoy, the friendly little discord bot.

-   **Motivating A Goldfish ([`freyam/MotivatingAGoldfish`](https://github.com/freyam/MotivatingAGoldfish))** is a browser extension that shows a disappointed video of me everytime you open a New Tab. It is highly useful when you want to get some work one and don't want to be distracted.

> Motivating A Goldfish is also useful to spook the goldfishes around you who are the laziest potatoes you have ever seen.

-   **GSOC Organizations Scrapper ([`freyam/gsoc-orgs-scrapper`](https://github.com/freyam/gsoc-orgs-scrapper))** is a simple web scrapper that scrapes the Google Summer of Code organizations list and returns the Organizations, Technologies, Slots, Ideas Page, Contact in JSON format.

> I made this project to show the mentors over at Dask that I could work around with DataFrames.

-   **Cat Classifier ([`freyam/cat-classifier`](https://github.com/freyam/cat-classifier))** is a classifier that classifies cats using a pre-trained L-layer Neural Network to classify cats vs non-cat images by using Logistic Regression and storing a cache to pass information from forward to back propagation. This was a guided project I made as part of the Deep Learning Specialization Course taught by Andrew NG.

-   **Number Signs Classifier ([`freyam/number-signs-classifier`](https://github.com/freyam/number-signs-classifier))** is a Deep Neural Network in Tensorflow to classify number signs by using Logistic Regression and applying optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam. This was also a guided project I made as part of the Deep Learning Specialization Course taught by Andrew NG.

-   **Paradise Hotel ([`freyam/paradise-hotel`](https://github.com/freyam/paradise-hotel))** is a CLI application implementing critical functions (add, search, modify, display, delete, payment, issue & return) that are required in a library by using an optimised database of books and customers.

> MY FIRST EVER PROJECT! I fell in love with C++ after this project. Lekshmi ma'am loved it and showed it to the whole class.

-   **State Library ([`freyam/state-library`](https://github.com/freyam/paradise-hotel))** is a CLI application implementing critical functions (add, search, modify, display, delete, payment, issue & return) that are required in a library by using an optimised database of books and customers.

These projects are all open source and I am always looking for new features and improvements to be added. So, if you feel like you can make any of these better, feel free to open a PR.
